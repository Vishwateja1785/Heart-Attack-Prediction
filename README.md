# Heart Attack Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting heart attacks using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Through extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering, I've developed models to accurately predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various health parameters.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Comprehensive analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features and optimization of existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various ML algorithms for heart attack prediction.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilization of neural networks for enhanced predictive capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more diverse datasets for improved generalization
- Experiment with ensemble methods for potentially higher accuracy
- Develop a user-friendly web interface for easy access to predictions
